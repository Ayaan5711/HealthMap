# MediFY

MediFY is an advanced platform designed for personalized medicine and bioinformatics analysis. It predicts diseases based on symptoms, identifies specific diseases, and offers personalized medicine for patient drug responses. The platform leverages state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the knowledge domain and streamline healthcare processes.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction**: Predicts potential diseases based on user-provided symptoms.
- **Disease Identification**: Identifies a particular disease from a list of symptoms, offering detailed information and recommended actions.
- **Personalized Medicine**: Provides personalized drug responses for patients, considering factors like age, gender, and medical history.
- **Knowledge Enhancement**: Utilizes cutting-edge LLMs and VLMs to provide comprehensive medical knowledge and assist healthcare professionals.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate interface for both patients and healthcare providers.
